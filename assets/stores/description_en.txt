This extension adds additional course information to the courses in your Udemy library.
It uses the Udemy API to retrieve additional information about the courses in your library and adds the following elements to each course:

•  The total runtime
•  The rating
•  The total number of ratings
•  The number of enrolled students
•  The date of the last update
•  Info about available subtitles

Additionally it displays a thin colored strip at the bottom of the course card, from red (3.5 stars and below) to green (5 stars).

This should give you a good idea of which course is worthwhile and which you might want to archive instead.

Note: If a course has stopped enrollment and is no longer publicly visible, no stats are available for that course.

If you like the extension, I'd appreciate a review!
